### Process

Our partnership with NexaCore Systems began with an extensive analysis of their manufacturing automation infrastructure. Through collaborative sessions with plant managers and automation engineers, we identified key bottlenecks in their production systems. Our team employed a data-driven approach, deploying IoT sensors and implementing real-time monitoring solutions. We developed a custom AI-powered control system that adapts to varying production demands while ensuring optimal resource utilization.

### Outcome

The implementation led to a 35% reduction in production downtime and a 50% improvement in predictive maintenance accuracy. The new smart manufacturing platform enabled real-time decision-making capabilities, resulting in a 28% increase in overall equipment effectiveness (OEE). NexaCore's innovative approach has positioned them as industry leaders in Industrial IoT solutions.
