**Case Study:** MySkills App\
**Company:** Treatmind GmbH\
**Location:** Berlin, Germany\
**Website:** [https://www.myskills.app/)


### Process

Our collaboration with VortexTech Dynamics revolutionized their computational fluid dynamics capabilities. Through intensive workshops with aerospace engineers and maritime specialists, we identified critical performance gaps in traditional simulation methods. Our team implemented a hybrid quantum-classical computing architecture, integrating advanced particle simulation algorithms with machine learning models. The resulting platform enables unprecedented accuracy in turbulence modeling and flow prediction across multiple scales.

### Outcome

The new simulation framework achieved a remarkable 65% reduction in computation time while improving accuracy by 40% compared to conventional methods. The platform's adaptive mesh refinement capabilities led to a 45% decrease in computational resource usage. VortexTech's breakthrough has enabled rapid prototyping of complex aerodynamic and hydrodynamic systems, establishing them as pioneers in quantum-enhanced simulation technology.
